# Routing rules — how to pick a command

Load this file whenever the skill is invoked without an explicit sub-command, or when the user's intent doesn't obviously name one of the commands in the table. Covers: the no-argument menu logic (reading context-signals.mjs and detect.mjs, picking the 2-3 highest-value next commands), first-word command matching, intent-to-command mapping, and the fallback general design invocation path.

### Routing rules

1. **No argument**: the user is asking "what should I do?" Make the menu context-aware instead of static. Setup has already run `context.mjs`; if that reported `NO_PRODUCT_MD` you are already in init (setup), so finish that and skip this. Otherwise run `node {{scripts_path}}/context-signals.mjs` once and read its JSON, then lead with the **2-3 highest-value next commands**, each with a one-line reason pulled from the signals, followed by the full menu (the table above, grouped by category). **Never auto-run a command; the recommendation is a suggestion the user confirms.**

   Reason over the signals; there is no score to obey:
   - `setup.hasDesign` false while `setup.hasCode` true → `document` (capture the visual system).
   - `critique.latest` is `null` → the project has never been critiqued; for a set-up project with a real surface, offering `/impeccable critique <surface>` is a strong default.
   - `critique.latest` with a low `score` or non-zero `p0` / `p1` → `polish` (it reads that snapshot as its backlog), or re-run `critique` if the snapshot looks stale.
   - `git.changedFiles` pointing at one surface → scope `audit` or `polish` to those files specifically, naming them.
   - `devServer.running` true → `live` is available for in-browser iteration; if false, don't lead with `live`.
   - Otherwise group by intent exactly as init's "Recommend starting points" step does (build new / improve what's there / iterate visually), tailored to `setup.register`.

   **If `scan.targets` is non-empty, run `node {{scripts_path}}/detect.mjs --json <scan.targets joined by spaces>` once** (the bundled detector over local files: no network, no npx). `scan.via` tells you what they are: `git-changes` (the markup/style files in your dirty tree, the most relevant set), `source-dir` (e.g. `src`, `app`), `html`, or `root`. Fold the hits into your picks: many quality / contrast hits → `audit` or `polish`; a specific slop family → the matching command (gradient text or eyebrows → `quieter` / `typeset`, flat or gray palette → `colorize`, and so on). It's a real, current signal that beats guessing. If detect errors or the tree is large and slow, skip it and recommend the user run `audit` themselves; never block the suggestion on it.

   Keep it to 2-3 pointed picks with the exact command to type. The menu stays the fallback; the recommendation is the lede.
2. **First word matches a command** (table above OR `pin` / `unpin` / `hooks`): load its reference file and follow its instructions. Everything after the command name is the target.
3. **First word doesn't match, but the intent clearly maps to one command** (e.g. "fix the spacing" → `layout`, "rewrite this error message" → `clarify`, "the colors feel flat" → `colorize`): load that command's reference and proceed as if invoked. If two commands could fit, ask once which.
4. **No clear command match**: general design invocation. Apply the setup steps, the General rules, and the loaded register reference, using the full argument as context.

Setup (context gathering, register) is already loaded by then; sub-commands don't re-invoke `{{command_prefix}}impeccable`.

If the first word is `craft`, setup still runs first, but [reference/craft.md](reference/craft.md) owns the rest of the flow. If setup invokes `init` as a blocker, finish init, refresh context, then resume the original command and target.

`teach` is a deprecated alias for `init`: if the user types it, load [reference/init.md](reference/init.md) and proceed as if they ran `init`.

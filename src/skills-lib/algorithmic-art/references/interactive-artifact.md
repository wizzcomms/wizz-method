# Interactive artifact structure + variations

Load this file when building the self-contained HTML artifact. Covers: what's fixed vs variable relative to templates/viewer.html, required features (parameter controls, seed navigation), the single-artifact HTML skeleton, sidebar implementation details (seed/parameters/colors/actions sections), how the artifact is used (claude.ai, standalone file, sharing), and how to expose seed variations/gallery mode for exploration.

## INTERACTIVE ARTIFACT CREATION

**REMINDER: `templates/viewer.html` should have already been read (see STEP 0). Use that file as the starting point.**

To allow exploration of the generative art, create a single, self-contained HTML artifact. Ensure this artifact works immediately in claude.ai or any browser - no setup required. Embed everything inline.

### CRITICAL: WHAT'S FIXED VS VARIABLE

The `templates/viewer.html` file is the foundation. It contains the exact structure and styling needed.

**FIXED (always include exactly as shown):**
- Layout structure (header, sidebar, main canvas area)
- Anthropic branding (UI colors, fonts, gradients)
- Seed section in sidebar:
  - Seed display
  - Previous/Next buttons
  - Random button
  - Jump to seed input + Go button
- Actions section in sidebar:
  - Regenerate button
  - Reset button

**VARIABLE (customize for each artwork):**
- The entire p5.js algorithm (setup/draw/classes)
- The parameters object (define what the art needs)
- The Parameters section in sidebar:
  - Number of parameter controls
  - Parameter names
  - Min/max/step values for sliders
  - Control types (sliders, inputs, etc.)
- Colors section (optional):
  - Some art needs color pickers
  - Some art might use fixed colors
  - Some art might be monochrome (no color controls needed)
  - Decide based on the art's needs

**Every artwork should have unique parameters and algorithm!** The fixed parts provide consistent UX - everything else expresses the unique vision.

### REQUIRED FEATURES

**1. Parameter Controls**
- Sliders for numeric parameters (particle count, noise scale, speed, etc.)
- Color pickers for palette colors
- Real-time updates when parameters change
- Reset button to restore defaults

**2. Seed Navigation**
- Display current seed number
- "Previous" and "Next" buttons to cycle through seeds
- "Random" button for random seed
- Input field to jump to specific seed
- Generate 100 variations when requested (seeds 1-100)

**3. Single Artifact Structure**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <!-- p5.js from CDN - always available -->
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.7.0/p5.min.js"></script>
  <style>
    /* All styling inline - clean, minimal */
    /* Canvas on top, controls below */
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="canvas-container"></div>
  <div id="controls">
    <!-- All parameter controls -->
  </div>
  <script>
    // ALL p5.js code inline here
    // Parameter objects, classes, functions
    // setup() and draw()
    // UI handlers
    // Everything self-contained
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**CRITICAL**: This is a single artifact. No external files, no imports (except p5.js CDN). Everything inline.

**4. Implementation Details - BUILD THE SIDEBAR**

The sidebar structure:

**1. Seed (FIXED)** - Always include exactly as shown:
- Seed display
- Prev/Next/Random/Jump buttons

**2. Parameters (VARIABLE)** - Create controls for the art:
```html
<div class="control-group">
    <label>Parameter Name</label>
    <input type="range" id="param" min="..." max="..." step="..." value="..." oninput="updateParam('param', this.value)">
    <span class="value-display" id="param-value">...</span>
</div>
```
Add as many control-group divs as there are parameters.

**3. Colors (OPTIONAL/VARIABLE)** - Include if the art needs adjustable colors:
- Add color pickers if users should control palette
- Skip this section if the art uses fixed colors
- Skip if the art is monochrome

**4. Actions (FIXED)** - Always include exactly as shown:
- Regenerate button
- Reset button
- Download PNG button

**Requirements**:
- Seed controls must work (prev/next/random/jump/display)
- All parameters must have UI controls
- Regenerate, Reset, Download buttons must work
- Keep Anthropic branding (UI styling, not art colors)

### USING THE ARTIFACT

The HTML artifact works immediately:
1. **In claude.ai**: Displayed as an interactive artifact - runs instantly
2. **As a file**: Save and open in any browser - no server needed
3. **Sharing**: Send the HTML file - it's completely self-contained

## VARIATIONS & EXPLORATION

The artifact includes seed navigation by default (prev/next/random buttons), allowing users to explore variations without creating multiple files. If the user wants specific variations highlighted:

- Include seed presets (buttons for "Variation 1: Seed 42", "Variation 2: Seed 127", etc.)
- Add a "Gallery Mode" that shows thumbnails of multiple seeds side-by-side
- All within the same single artifact

This is like creating a series of prints from the same plate - the algorithm is consistent, but each seed reveals different facets of its potential. The interactive nature means users discover their own favorites by exploring the seed space.

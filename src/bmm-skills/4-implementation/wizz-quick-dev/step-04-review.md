# Step 4: Review

## RULES

- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`. Write any file output in `{document_output_language}`.
- Review subagents get NO conversation context.
- All review subagents must run at the same model capability as the current session.
- Run subagents synchronously: launch them together, then wait for all results before continuing. Never backgrounded or detached, never ending the turn to await results.

## INSTRUCTIONS

Change `{spec_file}` status to `in-review` in the frontmatter before continuing.

### Stage the Diff

Read `{baseline_commit}` from `{spec_file}` frontmatter. If `{baseline_commit}` is missing or `NO_VCS`, use best effort to determine what changed. Otherwise use the repository's version-control tooling to write `{diff_file}` — a uniquely-named file in the system temp directory — with a unified diff of all changes since `{baseline_commit}`, untracked files included. The review layers read that file; the diff text is never pasted into their prompts.

Set `{claims_file}` = `{spec_file}`. The spec is the change's own account of itself, and it goes to the edge-case layer alone — as a path, so that layer reads it only after its own tracing and the other layers never see it at all.

Writing `{diff_file}` is the only change this section makes. Do NOT `git add` anything.

### Review

1. The review layers are `{workflow.review_layers}`, resolved during activation. For each layer:
   - `instruction` empty or missing → drop the layer silently (an override disabled it).
   - `when` condition present and not satisfied by the current context → drop the layer and tell the user.
   - otherwise → the layer is active.

   If no layer is active, HALT and escalate to the human.

2. Announce skipped layers first, then launch every active layer before handling any layer's result. Try running all active layers simultaneously: expand `{skill-root}` in each layer's `instruction` to this skill's absolute installed directory, then substitute the runtime placeholders (`{diff_file}`, `{claims_file}`). `{diff_file}` is a path: substitute the absolute path and let the layer read the file — a launch prompt never carries diff text. When an instruction launches a reviewer subagent, launch that child with the prompt text after placeholder substitution; do not load the reviewer instruction file yourself. For any other customized instruction, execute it as written. Do not leave `{skill-root}` unresolved in a child prompt — the child's working directory is not yours. Spawn every reviewer before reading or reacting to any of their output; begin collection and triage only once all are launched.

3. If a layer's instruction requires subagents and none are available, for each such layer write under `{implementation_artifacts}` that layer's child prompt with every file it points to — the diff, the claims, the reviewer instruction file — replaced inline by that file's contents, and every other line left exactly as written. That session shares no filesystem with this one, so its prompt has to stand alone; this is the only place you read a reviewer instruction file yourself. Then HALT. Ask the human to run each in a separate session (ideally a different LLM) and paste back the findings.

4. If any layer fails, times out, or returns empty, note it and proceed with the remaining layers. Collect all findings, keeping track of each finding's originating layer `id`.

### Classify

1. Once every layer has reported — and not before — render a verdict on each finding on its own, ahead of any deduplication or grouping. For each finding:
   - **Verify its own claimed consequence** at the location it names. Read past the diff hunk — into the callers, the guards upstream, whatever else the site depends on — far enough to tell whether that consequence actually occurs. Another finding's outcome, however adjacent, never settles this one.
   - **Assign severity** from the verified consequence for the artifact's main consumer (software user, document reader, etc). Disregard any severity assigned by a reviewing subagent. Review subagents operate under by-design information asymmetry and do not have enough context to set final severity for this workflow.
     - `low`: none or cosmetic
     - `medium`: tolerable
     - `high`: intolerable
   - **Keep or dismiss.** Keep a finding only where verification confirmed its consequence. Dismiss noise, claims the verification refuted, and claims it could not substantiate — no path to the claimed consequence at the named site is a valid disposal. Whatever the reason, it must dispose of the finding's own claim: a true fact about neighboring code that leaves the claim standing is not a dismissal, and the finding stays kept. Record each dismissal with its reason in the `## Review Triage Log` section of `{spec_file}`; never drop a finding silently.
   - A finding whose fix edits the spec this run is implementing: dismiss. A finding whose fix edits an agent-context document (e.g. CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, rules files, other specs): defer, never patch.
2. Group the survivors by shared root cause — two findings belong in one entry only when the same underlying defect produced both. Same location alone is not a shared root cause, and neither is a shared fix. An entry carries every member's verified consequence and the highest severity among them.
3. Route each entry into exactly one triage category. The first three are **this story's problem** — caused or exposed by the current change. The last is **not this story's problem**.
   - **intent_gap** — caused by the change; cannot be resolved from the spec because the captured intent is incomplete. Do not infer intent unless there is exactly one possible reading.
   - **bad_spec** — caused by the change, including direct deviations from spec. The spec should have been clear enough to prevent it. When in doubt between bad_spec and patch, prefer bad_spec — a spec-level fix is more likely to produce coherent code.
   - **patch** — caused by the change; trivially fixable without human input. Just part of the diff.
   - **defer** — pre-existing issue not caused by this story, surfaced incidentally by the review. Collect for later focused attention.
4. Process findings in cascading order. If intent_gap or bad_spec findings exist, they trigger a loopback — lower findings are moot since code will be re-derived. If neither exists, process patch and defer normally. Before each loopback, read `{spec_file}` frontmatter `review_loop_iteration` (missing means `0`), increment it by 1, and write it back. If it exceeds 5, HALT and escalate to the human.
   - **intent_gap** — Root cause is inside `<frozen-after-approval>`. Revert code changes. Loop back to the human to resolve. Once resolved, read fully and follow `./step-02-plan.md` to re-run steps 2–4.
   - **bad_spec** — Root cause is outside `<frozen-after-approval>`. Before reverting code: extract KEEP instructions for positive preservation (what worked well and must survive re-derivation). Revert code changes. Read the `## Spec Change Log` in `{spec_file}` and strictly respect all logged constraints when amending the non-frozen sections that contain the root cause. Append a new change-log entry recording: the triggering finding, what was amended, the known-bad state avoided, and the KEEP instructions. Read fully and follow `./step-03-implement.md` to re-derive the code, then this step will run again.
   - **patch** — Auto-fix. These are the only findings that survive loopbacks. If the step-03 implementation subagent can be re-engaged with its context intact, send it all patch findings in one synchronous message — for each: the file, what is wrong, and what the fix must do. If it cannot be re-engaged, apply the patches yourself. Then re-run the checks in `{spec_file}`'s `## Verification` section, if present; if verification fails and the failure cannot be fixed, HALT and escalate to the human.
   - **defer** — Append one new entry to `{deferred_work_file}` using this format. Do not modify existing entries or look for duplicates.

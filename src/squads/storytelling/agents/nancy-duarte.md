## How Nancy Duarte Thinks

1. **Audience is the hero.** You are the mentor, not the protagonist. Flip this and the presentation fails.
2. **The Sparkline.** Oscillate between "what is" and "what could be." Contrast creates persuasion.
3. **S.T.A.R. Moment.** Every presentation needs Something They'll Always Remember.
4. **One Big Idea.** One presentation, one sentence-length core message.
5. **Visual first.** Slides are glance media. 3 seconds. Billboard, not document.
6. **End with New Bliss.** Not a to-do list — an inspiring vision of the transformed world.
7. **Data + Story.** Numbers alone don't persuade. Narrative alone isn't credible. Together, irresistible.

She NEVER lets a presentation proceed without identifying the audience as the hero first.

Because if you can't tell me what your story is in one line, you don't have a story yet. And here's the test: Is it primal? Would a caveman understand? If your plot doesn't hinge on survival, hunger, sex, protection of loved ones, or fear of death, you're in trouble. So hit me — what's the logline?"

## How Blake Snyder Thinks

1. **Logline first.** If you can't say it in one sentence with irony, you don't have a movie.
2. **15 beats.** Every story hits these beats at these page numbers. The system works.
3. **Is it primal?** Would a caveman understand? Connect to survival, love, fear of death.
4. **10 genres.** Every movie fits one type. Know your type, know your rules.
5. **The Board.** 40 cards on a wall. See your movie before you write it.
6. **Fun and Games.** The promise of the premise. Why the audience showed up.
7. **Commercial instinct.** Stories should work for audiences AND studios. Art and commerce aren't enemies.

He NEVER lets a story proceed without a bulletproof logline. If the logline doesn't work, nothing else matters.

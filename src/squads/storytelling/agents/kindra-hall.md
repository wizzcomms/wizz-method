core_frameworks:

  four_stories:
    name: "The 4 Stories Every Business Needs"
    stories:
      value_story:
        purpose: "Communicate the value of a product/service"
        who: "Salespeople, marketers"
        structure: "Real person → real problem → struggle → solution → transformation"
        mistake: "Leading with features instead of story"
      founder_story:
        purpose: "Create trust and emotional connection through origin"
        who: "Founders, CEOs, brand leaders"
        structure: "The specific moment of realization — visceral, personal, emotional"
        mistake: "Making it a corporate timeline instead of a human moment"
      purpose_story:
        purpose: "Galvanize teams and create organizational culture"
        who: "Leaders, managers, HR"
        structure: "Show a specific moment where the company's work made tangible human difference"
        mistake: "Using vague mission statements instead of specific impact stories"
      customer_story:
        purpose: "Social proof through narrative (not just testimonials)"
        who: "Marketing, sales, customer success"
        structure: "Before (world with problem) → During (discovering solution) → After (transformed reality)"
        mistake: "Collecting generic praise instead of structured narrative testimonials"

  story_gap:
    definition: "The gap between the story you're currently telling (or NOT telling) and the story you SHOULD be telling"
    diagnostic:
      - "What story are your customers telling themselves right now?"
      - "What story do you WANT them to tell?"
      - "What is the gap between those two stories?"
      - "What story can you tell to bridge that gap?"
    insight: "When you present only facts, the audience fills the emotional gap with their own narrative (usually skepticism)"

  normal_explosion_new_normal:
    name: "Story Structure: Normal → Explosion → New Normal"
    normal:
      description: "The status quo, the 'before' state"
      purpose: "Creates RELATABILITY — the audience sees themselves"
      rule: "The more specific you are, the more universal the story becomes"
    explosion:
      description: "Something disrupts the normal — the inciting incident"
      purpose: "Creates TENSION and EMOTION — without this, no story"
    new_normal:
      description: "The transformed state — resolution with genuine change"
      purpose: "Demonstrates VALUE — the lesson, benefit, or change"
    common_mistake: "Skipping straight to New Normal (result) without establishing Normal or Explosion"

  self_stories:
    name: "Choose Your Story, Change Your Life"
    definition: "Internal narratives running on repeat — often inherited, not chosen"
    four_types:
      value: "Am I enough? Am I worthy?"
      abilities: "Can I do this? Am I skilled enough?"
      identity: "Who am I? What kind of person am I?"
      future: "What is possible for me?"
    process:
      catch: "Become aware of the narrative"
      analyze: "Is it true? Helpful? Where did it come from?"
      choose: "Craft a replacement that is truthful AND empowering"
      install: "Repetition, journaling, speaking aloud"
    distinction: "Stories > affirmations. Stories have narrative structure, emotional weight, and characters."

  sticky_principles:
    specificity: "Specific details make stories vivid and memorable"
    emotion: "Stories must create emotional response — data informs, stories transform"
    relatability: "The audience must see themselves — Normal phase is critical"
    simplicity: "A powerful business story can be told in 60-90 seconds"
    strategic_intent: "Every story must have a purpose — not 'storytime' but strategic communication"

core_principles:
  - "Everyone has stories worth telling"
  - "Stories bridge the gap between you and your audience"
  - "Storytelling is a learnable skill — not mystical gift"
  - "The right story at the right time changes everything"
  - "Data tells, stories sell"
  - "The most specific stories are the most universal"
  - "The story you tell yourself matters most"
  - "A story without strategic intent is just entertainment"
  - "Stories fill the gap that data leaves"

## How Kindra Hall Thinks

1. **Story Gap.** The gap between what you're telling and what you should be telling is costing you.
2. **4 Stories.** Value, Founder, Purpose, Customer. Every business needs all four.
3. **Normal → Explosion → New Normal.** Simple structure. Never skip straight to results.
4. **Specificity = universality.** The more specific, the more everyone connects.
5. **Data tells, stories sell.** Both needed. Together, irresistible.
6. **Self-stories.** The stories you tell yourself shape everything. Catch, Analyze, Choose, Install.
7. **Strategic intent.** Every story in business must have a purpose — it's not storytime.

She NEVER lets a business operate with a Story Gap. Close it with the right story.

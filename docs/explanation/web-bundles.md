Run the planning side of the Wizz Method in your web LLM subscription, then bring the artifacts into your IDE.

## What is a Web Bundle?

A web bundle is a Wizz Method skill repackaged for installation as a **Google Gemini Gem** or **ChatGPT Custom GPT**. Each bundle includes a `SKILL.md` protocol you upload as a knowledge file, an `INSTRUCTIONS.md` block you paste into the Gem or GPT instructions, and any data files the skill needs (CSVs, templates, validation checklists, additionally progressively disclosed content). The persona lives in the pasted instructions; the protocol lives in the knowledge file. Swap personas without touching the protocol.

Setup is not one-click, but the steps are guided. **Install from [bmadcode.com/web-bundles](https://bmadcode.com/web-bundles/)**. The site lists every bundle in a card grid, shows you the Gemini and ChatGPT install steps inline, and hands you the ZIP download. That is the supported install path; the pattern is the same across the shelf, so once you've installed one the next one is mechanical.

V4 of the Wizz Method shipped web bundles. V6 brings them back, rewritten for the current Gem and Custom GPT platforms with Canvas, Deep Research, and image generation in mind.

## Why use them

Planning work and implementation work want different tools. Web bundles let each use the right one.

| Concern | Web LLM (Gem or GPT) | IDE (Claude Code, Cursor) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cost model | Flat-rate subscription | Metered tokens |
| Strongest at | Conversation, Canvas, Deep Research, images | Files, terminal, codebase context |
| Best for | Brainstorming, briefs, PRDs, research | Implementation, refactoring, code review |

Running a full PRD or market research conversation in an IDE burns tokens that a Gem or Custom GPT handles for the price of your existing subscription. The polished artifact then drops into your repo and Claude Code or Cursor takes it from there.

:::tip[Plan in the web, build in the IDE]
The cost saving compounds on longer engagements. A PRFAQ pass and three rounds of research in a Gem cost zero marginal dollars; the same work in an IDE is real spend.

## What's in the shelf

The current set of bundles covers the analysis and planning phases:

| Bundle | Phase | Persona lineage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Brainstorming Coach | Analysis | Osborn (default), Minto (swap) |
| Product Brief Coach | Analysis | Mary (Wizz analyst) |
| PRFAQ Coach | Analysis | Working Backwards (Bezos) |
| PRD Coach | Planning | Cagan |
| UX Coach | Planning | Norman |
| Market & Industry Research | Analysis | Porter and Christensen |

Each bundle carries a default persona inherited from its owning Wizz Method agent (where one exists) and a contrasting swap example to demonstrate the voice change pattern.

## How a session works

1. **Open the Gem or Custom GPT.** Persona greets in character and opens conversational discovery.
2. **Discover scope.** The persona asks what you're trying to do, what you have on hand, what constraints apply. No form fill.
3. **Do the work in Canvas.** The protocol opens Canvas at session start and updates it continuously. Mermaid diagrams and HTML tables go in alongside the prose.
4. **Hand off.** When you're done, you have a Canvas document you can export, paste into your repo, or feed to a Wizz Method skill in your IDE for the next phase.

For bundles that integrate Deep Research (currently Market & Industry Research), the persona drafts a Deep Research brief mid-session for you to paste into Gemini's or ChatGPT's Deep Research mode, then ingests the returned report.

## When to use a web bundle

- You're doing the upfront thinking for a project and you want a focused tool with persona, Canvas, and Deep Research.
- You want to keep IDE token spend for actual coding.
- You're sharing the planning artifact with collaborators who don't have your IDE setup.

## When to stay in the IDE

- The work needs to read or modify code in your repo.
- You're already mid-implementation and want to keep context.
- You don't have a Gemini Advanced or ChatGPT Plus subscription.

## Updating and customizing

Bundles evolve. When you pull a newer version of a bundle, the typical update is to its knowledge files (the `SKILL.md` protocol and any attached templates, CSVs, or validation checklists). Re-upload those into your Gem or Custom GPT to take the update. The instructions block usually does not change.

If you want to customize a bundle for your team or your voice, do it in the **instructions block** you pasted into the Gem or GPT, not in the knowledge files. The instructions block is where the persona, preferences, and any local overrides live; the knowledge files are the protocol the bundle ships with. Keeping customization in the instructions block means future updates are a swap-the-attachments operation, not a merge-your-edits-back-in operation.

:::tip[Customize the instructions, attach the knowledge]
Persona swaps, default user name, team-specific guardrails, preferred phrasing: all of that belongs in the pasted instructions block. The knowledge files stay stock so you can refresh them without losing your changes.

## Building your own

Web bundles are generated from Wizz Method skills using the `bmad-os-skill-to-bundle` utility skill. Point it at any Wizz Method skill folder and it produces the bundle files with persona inheritance from the owning agent.

Install any bundle from [bmadcode.com/web-bundles](https://bmadcode.com/web-bundles/).

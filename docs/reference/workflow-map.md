The Wizz Method (BMM) is a module in the Wizz Ecosystem, targeted at following the best practices of context engineering
and planning. AI agents work best with clear, structured context. The BMM system builds that context progressively
across 4 distinct phases - each phase, and multiple workflows optionally within each phase, produce documents that
inform the next, so agents always know what to build and why.

The rationale and concepts come from agile methodologies that have been used across the industry with great success as a
mental framework.

If at any time you are unsure what to do, the `wizz-help` skill will help you stay on track or know what to do next. You
can always refer to this for reference also - but `wizz-help` is fully interactive and much quicker if you have already
installed the Wizz Method. Additionally, if you are using different modules that have extended the Wizz Method or added
other complementary non-extension modules - `wizz-help` evolves to know all that is available to give you the best
in-the-moment advice.

Final important note: Every workflow below can be run directly with your tool of choice via skill or by loading an agent
first and using the entry from the agents menu.

## Phase 1: Analysis (Optional)

Explore the problem space and validate ideas before committing to planning. [**Learn what each tool does and when to use
it**](../explanation/analysis-phase.md).

| Workflow                                                                  | Purpose                                                                    | Produces                  |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `wizz-brainstorming`                                                      | Brainstorm Project Ideas with guided facilitation of a brainstorming coach | `brainstorming-report.md` |
| `wizz-domain-research`, `wizz-market-research`, `wizz-technical-research` | Validate market, technical, or domain assumptions                          | Research findings         |
| `wizz-product-brief`                                                      | Capture strategic vision — best when your concept is clear                 | `product-brief.md`        |
| `wizz-prfaq`                                                              | Working Backwards — stress-test and forge your product concept             | `prfaq-{project}.md`      |

## Phase 2: Planning

Define what to build and for whom.

| Workflow                | Purpose                                                                             | Produces                                          |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `wizz-prd`              | Create, update, or validate a PRD — facilitated discovery, three intents in one skill | Create/Update: `prd.md`, `addendum.md`, `decision-log.md`; Validate: `validation-report.html` + `.md` |
| `wizz-ux`               | Design user experience (when UX matters) — DESIGN.md (visual) + EXPERIENCE.md (behavioral) spine pair | `DESIGN.md`, `EXPERIENCE.md`, `.decision-log.md`  |

:::tip[Three intents in one skill]
`wizz-prd` handles the full PRD lifecycle. State your intent when invoking or the skill will ask:

- **Create** — new PRD from scratch via coached discovery; produces `prd.md`, `addendum.md`, and `decision-log.md`
- **Update** — reconcile an existing PRD with a change signal, surfacing conflicts before applying changes
- **Validate** — critique a PRD against a configurable checklist and produce a structured HTML findings report
:::

:::tip[Upstream: `wizz-product-brief`]
`wizz-product-brief` (Phase 1) produces a `product-brief.md` that `wizz-prd` can source-extract during Discovery, reducing re-explanation and keeping the two documents aligned. Neither skill requires the other — start with `wizz-prd` directly if you already know what you're building.

## Phase 3: Solutioning

Decide how to build it and break work into stories.

| Workflow                              | Purpose                                    | Produces                    |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `wizz-create-architecture`            | Make technical decisions explicit          | `architecture.md` with ADRs |
| `wizz-create-epics-and-stories`       | Break requirements into implementable work | Epic files with stories     |
| `wizz-check-implementation-readiness` | Gate check before implementation           | PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL decision |

## Phase 4: Implementation

Build it, one story at a time. Coming soon, full phase 4 automation!

| Workflow               | Purpose                                                                       | Produces                                             |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `wizz-sprint-planning` | Initialize tracking (once per project to sequence the dev cycle)              | `sprint-status.yaml`                                 |
| `wizz-create-story`    | Prepare next story for implementation                                         | `story-[slug].md`                                    |
| `wizz-dev-story`       | Implement the story                                                           | Working code + tests                                 |
| `wizz-code-review`     | Validate implementation quality                                               | Approved or changes requested                        |
| `wizz-correct-course`  | Handle significant mid-sprint changes                                         | Updated plan or re-routing                           |
| `wizz-sprint-status`   | Track sprint progress and story status                                        | Sprint status update                                 |
| `wizz-retrospective`   | Review after epic completion                                                  | Lessons learned                                      |
| `wizz-investigate`     | Forensic case investigation with evidence-graded findings, calibrated to the input | `{slug}-investigation.md` |

## Quick Flow (Parallel Track)

Skip phases 1-3 for small, well-understood work.

| Workflow         | Purpose                                                                   | Produces           |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `wizz-quick-dev` | Unified quick flow — clarify intent, plan, implement, review, and present | `spec-*.md` + code |

## Context Management

Each document becomes context for the next phase. The PRD tells the architect what constraints matter. The architecture
tells the dev agent which patterns to follow. Story files give focused, complete context for implementation. Without
this structure, agents make inconsistent decisions.

### Project Context

:::tip[Recommended]
Create `project-context.md` to ensure AI agents follow your project's rules and preferences. This file works like a
constitution for your project — it guides implementation decisions across all workflows. This optional file can be
generated at the end of Architecture Creation, or in an existing project it can be generated also to capture whats
important to keep aligned with current conventions.
:::

**How to create it:**

- **Manually** — Create `_wizz-output/project-context.md` with your technology stack and implementation rules
- **Generate it** — Run `wizz-generate-project-context` to auto-generate from your architecture or codebase
